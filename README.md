# General Purpose Viewer (GPV)

The General Purpose Viewer is an ASP.NET web application that integrates web mapping
with enterprise databases.  It displays web maps generated from Esri's ArcGIS for Server 
or ArcIMS.  It can access enterprise data in any database management system that has an 
OLEDB .NET Provider and supports stored procedures.  An administrator can define web 
mapping applications in the GPV by populating a set of configuration tables.

The GPV grew out of a project originally conceived by the City of Cambridge, 
Massachusetts in 2004.  Since then it has been deployed in over 20 city, county and 
regional GIS departments.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/AppGeo/GPV/wiki) for complete documentation 
on the GPV.
