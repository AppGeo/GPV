Zip file generation provided by SharpZipLib (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib)
licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the following exception:

  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based
  on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
  combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission to link this 
  library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of 
  these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your 
  choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions 
  of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or 
  based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version 
  of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this 
  exception statement from your version.

  Note: The exception is changed to reflect the latest GNU Classpath exception. Older versions of 
  #ziplib did have another exception, but the new one is clearer and it doesn't break compatibility 
  with the old one.

  Bottom line: In plain English this means you can use this library in commercial closed-source 
  applications.
